# scLightGAT ‚ö°
> A Self-Attention Graph Neural Network and LightGBM-based Tool for Cell Type Annotation in scRNA-seq

**scLightGAT** is an integrated tool for automated cell type annotation in **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)** datasets.  
It uniquely combines:

-  **Differential Gene Expression (DGE)** for prominent marker gene selection  
-  **Contrastive Denoising Variational Autoencoder (C-DVAE)** for latent feature extraction  
-  **LightGBM** for first-stage classification  
-  **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** for topology-aware prediction refinement

Tested on five independent GEO cancer datasets, scLightGAT achieves an average annotation accuracy of **0.962**, outperforming existing methods including CellTypist, CHETAH, and scGPT&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## Framework Description
scLightGAT is structured into three major stages:

1. Feature Extraction

- Removes low-quality cells, applies normalization and HVG filtering

- Performs DGE analysis and C-DVAE latent encoding on HVGs

2. Feature Fusion + Classification

- Concatenates DGE marker genes with C-DVAE latent vectors

- LightGBM predicts coarse cell types with high efficiency

3.Graph-based Refinement

- Constructs cell graphs using UMAP and Harmony representation

- GAT leverages attention across neighboring cells to refine predictions

This architecture improves cell type resolution (e.g. CAF subtypes) and maintains cross-dataset generalizability in cancer applications‚Äã
